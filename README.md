# What is this Project?
* a program for building worlds similar to VR Chat, or my other game engine projects

# What makes it Deeper?
* everything can be designed from within the environment

    - very minimal recompiling
    - satisfying to see the world being built around, maybe features that emphasize progression
    - everything is integrated into the environment (no UI)
        * Makes for intuitive design
        * Is aesthetic

* Power to integrate and add whatever features I want

    - really low-level graphics features
    - low-level integration of VM's, text editors, web browsers

# A High-Level Overview:
### Core:
 - [ ] Window
 - [ ] Scene Renderer
 - [ ] Text Rendering
 - [ ] Input Handling
 - [ ] Camera
 - [ ] Scripting System

 - [ ] Hub-World Design and Logic
 - [ ] Context Switching (making a good loading system for assets and worlds)

 - [ ] Audio System

### Machines and Art:
 - [ ] SDF Rendering
 - [ ] Lots of Post Processing Shaders
 - [ ] Voxel Renderer
 - [ ] Lighting System

 - [ ] Terminal
 - [ ] Text Editor
 - [ ] Integrated Information System (touch anything and get information)
   [ ]  - Visualising data

 - [ ] Audio Tools, and synths
 - [ ] Visual Synthesizers?
 - [ ] Deep Learning tools (visual scripting?)

 - [ ] Cellular Automata

### Multiplayer:
MULTIPLAYER, so I don't know what this means, because
doing networked physics and stuff in these crazy environments is going to be
somewhat difficult, but here is my goal with this project so I can clarify.

### Storytelling:
some world's will tell a story, they are scenes from my head, 
and they have procedurally generated lore

### Leveling it up:
VR

# A Note on optimization
Throughout all of this OPTIMIZATION is very important.
Making all of this as optimized as possible and having really good context switching and asset loading is crucially important

# So that is what this project is: 
- fundamentally it is for art: playing around with light and cellular automata,
and fundamentally just going back to what it felt like in the minecraft days
where prototyping and playing and creating felt fast, and integrating information
and creating with it could be done in a matter of moments
- to tell a story: and for telling a story of what it is like to exist in my head, 
and have all of these things floating around, a story of what it feels like 
to create all of these internal realities that you feel you 
escape into more and more, 
- to actually build something: and this is the test of whether I can 
use any of those internal realities to actually build anything on the outside, its time to 
build some real understanding, because when is the last 
time I did that, and this understanding is testable
