A Vulkan Rendering Object Model:
    Each Frame:
        Record Command Buffer:
            A renderer object:
                Begin a renderpass (say a standard forward render)
                with associated attachment objects:
                    For each Subpass/Pipeline:
                        Bind Pipeline 
                        Bind Associated Descriptors:
                            Bind Object Descriptors
                            Draw Command
                Begin another renderpass (post process)
        End Recording:

Objects:
    Renderpass
    Subpass/Pipeline

Resources:
    Attachment
    Shader Module
    Textures
    Framebuffers
    Descriptors
    Buffers

Example Instantantion of these objects:
    Scene Renderer:
        containing a renderpass for rendering to texture used the scene renderer 
        containing a scene forward pass renderpass
            containing separate pipelines for materials
        containing a post processing pass
    Deferred Renderer:
