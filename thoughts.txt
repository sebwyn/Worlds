Alright, this is my new worlds project, I just got a new neovim, NvChad, it seems
pretty nice, I want to use it to build this project, I'm pretty hyped lowkey

so what is this project, because in my head, it is literally just another
game engine, sure at its core it is about building worlds, like building
worlds in VR chat right, but what makes it deeper, it seems to me like
I want an environment where I can design from within the environment right
I feel like it would be extremely satisfying to not have to recompile everytime
and to see the world built around me, and to have lots of power with the graphics
card and everything from within the game, I think that would be sick as fuck
genuinely, but the cpp infrastructure that I need around that feels really deep

aight so progress, this is the progression:
- I need a fucking window
glfw, something else?
- I need a way to have objects drawn into the scene
- I need to have text drawn into the scene
- I need to have something that runs scripts that people
create while playing the game
- I basically need some device in the game that is tied into
events in my engine right like I need a computer that 
has events that take the text buffers and shit, turn them
into scripts and run them
- and then I need machines: I need weird machines that people
can play with and create with, audio and visual synthesizers,
mathematically generated terrain, that people can tweek the 
values of, I just want a testing ground, 


and on top of all of this

MULTIPLAYER, so I don't know what this means, because
doing networked physics and stuff in these crazy environments is going to be
somewhat difficult, but here is my goal with this project so I can clarify

I want to build something, I have this summer to do it, I know 
there is a good chance nothing comes from this file, and it gets
left on my machine as another journal that just got moved into
a fucking project folder that never actually filled out, but
my goal with this project is to actually build something, 
and I know I already fucking said that, but I don't even care
mentally I feel so distraught recently, and all I wanna do is
focus on that and go deeper into that, this project is supposed
to be an escape from that, but also a test, can I put that 
effort somewhere else, can I get out of my own really negative thought
loops and then look back on them, and express them artistically 
in the form of these worlds, and get satisfaction from that.

So that is what this project is, this project at its core 
after all of the programming is for art, it is for generating
it is for playing with cellular automata, it is for playing 
with light, and for playing with shaders, it is about creating
a story of what it is like to exist in my head, and have all of 
these things floating around, a story of what it feels like 
to create all of these internal realities that you feel you 
escape into more and more, and this is the test of whether
I can use any of those internal realities to actually build 
anything on the outside, its time to build some real fucking
understanding, because when is the last time I did that, and
this understanding is fucking testable, because rather than feeling
like I'm dealing with people that I don't know how to read, and 
that I feel like can just play more fucking mindgames on me,
I'm dealing with a fucking computer that will spit out fucking
error messages, so lets put that fucking "intelligence" to work am i right
god damn, bet that am i right

I lowkey like this set up though with toggling with <TAB> that shit is nice
